# To-Do-List
To-Do List App

A simple yet effective mobile application designed for daily task management.

  Developed using Flutter and Dart, with a clean and responsive Material UI.

  Implemented local data persistence using shared_preferences, ensuring tasks remain saved across app sessions.

   Core features include
   
   Adding, deleting, and marking tasks as completed
   Visual feedback for completed tasks (strikethrough, check icon, etc.)
   Persistent storage without external database dependencies
   Focused on user-centric design and state management using the Provider package for smooth and reactive UI updates.
   Built with modular and readable code structure, making it easy to scale or integrate cloud services like Firebase in the future.
